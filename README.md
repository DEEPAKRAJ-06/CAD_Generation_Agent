# CAD Generation Agent (Agentic Workflow)

This project implements an **agentic CAD generation pipeline** inspired by recent research on human-in-the-loop CAD workflows.

## Current Status
Step-1: Design Intention Clarification & Parsing (COMPLETE)

## Architecture
- LangGraph-based agent workflow
- Human-in-the-loop clarification
- Structured design intent parsing
- LangSmith-based evaluation

## Roadmap

* [ ] Step-2: Constraint Parser
* [ ] Step-3: CAD Geometry Planning
* [ ] Step-4: OpenSCAD / CAD Code Generation
* [ ] Step-5: Geometry Verification
